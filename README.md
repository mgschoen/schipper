# Schipper

A very silly browser game written in Vanilla JS. You are a boat captain and have to find locations in Hamburg in a limited amount of time, using only waterways.

This game was my way of finding orientation in the new city after I moved to Hamburg and the pandemic prevented me from actually going out.

It's never finished, but still fun to look at.

## Run locally

You will need NodeJS 13.x to be able to run the game. To start in development mode, simply run

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
